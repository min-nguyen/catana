### About
A simple Haskell DSL for composing neural networks layers, using the free monad and coproducts, and training them, using folds (**cat*amorphisms) and unfolds (**ana**morphisms).

This implementation accompanies the paper "[_**Folding Over Neural Networks**_](https://github.com/min-nguyen/folding-neural-nets/blob/main/paper.pdf)" (also available here: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16912-0_5` / https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01090)
