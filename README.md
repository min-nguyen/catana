### About
Catana is a Haskell DSL for composing neural networks layers, using the free monad and coproducts, and training them, using folds (**cat**amorphisms) and unfolds (**ana**morphisms).

This implementation accompanies the paper "[_**Folding Over Neural Networks**_](https://github.com/min-nguyen/folding-neural-nets/blob/main/paper.pdf)",  published in [Mathematics of Program Construction, 2022](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16912-0_5).
